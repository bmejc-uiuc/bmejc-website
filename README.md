Opening react page while editing: npm start
Reminder to save your work (save all for all files) when commiting
1. Pulling - do this before commiting so you have the most up-to-date code, it will pull all updates from all files: git pull
NOTE: Sometimes it will not let you commit, so before doing a commit command do "git add ." then the commit command and push right after
2. Commiting: git commit -m "insert message here"
3. Pushing - pushes code to github, always do this after committing: git push
